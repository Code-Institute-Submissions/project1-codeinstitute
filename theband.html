                                <br> This will of course mean that the band are not available for other events during this tour.

                                        The Monkees are an American rock and pop band originally active between 1966 and 1971, 
                                        with reunion albums and tours in the decades that followed. They were formed in Los Angeles
                                        in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider for the American television series
                                        The Monkees which aired from 1966 to 1968. The musical acting quartet was composed of 
                                        Americans Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork; and English actor and singer 
                                        Davy Jones. The band's music was initially supervised by producer Don Kirshner, 
                                        backed by the songwriting duo of Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart.
                                        <br> The four actor-musicians were allowed only limited roles in the recording studio
                                        for the first few months of their five-year career as "the Monkees". This was due in 
                                        part to the amount of time required to film
                                        the television series. Nonetheless, Nesmith did compose and produce some songs from
                                        the beginning, and Peter Tork contributed limited guitar work on the sessions produced 
                                        by Nesmith. They eventually fought for the right
                                        to collectively supervise all musical output under the band's name.
                                        <br> The television show was canceled in 1968, but the band continued to record music
                                        through 1971. A revival of interest in the television show came in 1986, which led to 
                                        a series of reunion tours and new records.
                                        The group has reunited and toured several times since then with different line-ups and
                                        varying degrees of success.
                                        <br> After Davy Jones died on February 29, 2012, the surviving members reunited for a 
                                        tour in November–December 2012 and again in 2013 for a 24-date tour. The Monkees 
                                        continued to tour through their 2016 50th Anniversary,
                                        with Dolenz and Tork forming the core of the band and Nesmith continuing to join them 
                                        occasionally. Dolenz described The Monkees as initially being "a TV show about an 
                                        imaginary band… that wanted to be the Beatles that
                                        was never successful". Ironically, the actor-musicians became one of the most successful
                                        bands of the 1960s.
                                        <br> The Monkees have sold more than 75 million records worldwide making them one of the
                                        biggest selling groups of all time with international hits, including "Last Train to 
                                        Clarksville", "Pleasant Valley Sunday", "Daydream
                                        Believer", and "I'm a Believer". Newspapers and magazines reported that the Monkees 
                                        outsold the Beatles and the Rolling Stones combined in 1967, but Nesmith claims in 
                                        his autobiography Infinite Tuesday that it was a lie that he told an Australian reporter.

                                Manchester, on 30 December 1945. His television 
                                acting debut was on the British television soap 
                                opera Coronation Street. He portrayed Colin Lomax,
                                Ena Sharples' grandson, for one episode on 6 March 1961.
                                <br> He also appeared in the BBC police series Z-Cars.
                                He dropped out of secondary school to begin his 
                                career as a jockey. This career was short-lived,
                                however. Even though his trainer believed Jones 
                                would be successful
                                as a jockey, he encouraged his young protege to 
                                take a role as the Artful Dodger in a production 
                                of Oliver! in London's West End, a move which 
                                changed Jones' life forever.

                                    offered a publishing deal for his songs, and it
                                    was while Nesmith was at this publishing 
                                    house that Barry Friedman brought the ad for

                                    which required real-life musical talent.

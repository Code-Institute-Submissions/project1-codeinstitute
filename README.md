I am building this website for a fictional band based on The Monkees. It is for
fans and potential fans. 
It is also aimed at giving people an opportunity to both listen to their music 
and book them to play at events.

<h2>UX</h2>
*Target audiences= fans and potential fans.

*To see/hear clips from back catalog, and new material as it becomes available.

*To showcase their music.

*To publicise availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas 
parties.

<h3>Strategy Plane</h3> <h4>What are you aiming to achieve in the first place 
and for whom</h4>
A website for fans, potential fans and customers who may want to book the band 
for events. 

<h3>Scope Plane</h3> <h4>Which features based on information from the strategy 
plane do you want to include in your design? </h4>

Enquiry form - for booking gigs. 

Band photos - images displayed in Bootstrap grid.

Spotify plugin - to allow people try band's music

Youtube plugin - To see/hear clips from back catalog and showcase talents on 
booking page.

Social sharing buttons - for fans to share music and engage with fellow fans.

Tour date page with button to third party site for tickets

<h3>Structure Plane</h3> <h4>How is the information structured and how is it 
logically grouped?</h4>
Interaction Design - I use a traditional navigation system with a navigation bar 
across the top as well as a band logo functioning as a link to homepage.

Information Architecture - I aim to keep things clear and easy for users by having
seperate pages for bookings, tour dates, photos and news with identical nav and
footer layouts on all pages. 
The main section of the page will change but I aim to stick to the maroon 
and grey color schemes.


<h3>Skeleton Plane</h3> <h4>How will our information be represented and how will
the user navigate to the information and the features?</h4> 
I decided that I would create four boxes on each page, one for each of the four 
types of information.
Scrolling would be used, as necessary, to allow all the desired information to 
be available within the box.
Interface Design means incorporating features like buttons in a way that users 
can easily interact with
the site. Since my site is quite simple I really did not need to do much design 
here. I just kept in mind
that my site should have a familiar look similar to other common sites.
Navigation Design is the method we provide for the user to move through the site,
successfully reaching
the desired sections. I decided to have three types of navigation:
(1) A top navigation bar that would be arranged in order of importance. This option would 
be suitable for
students interested in reaching my page about a particular course.[delete]

<h3>Surface Plane</h3> <h4>What will the finished product look like? or what 
colors typography and design elements will we use? </h4>

The design will be consistent and visually appealing to customers/fans. A retro
theme will be aimed for to match the time of the band's breakout years. 

Colors - maroon and grey. 
Font - I used 'Spicy Rice' and 'Acme' both Google Fonts. I felt Spicy Rice was 
the perfect fit for 'The Monkees' - giving a retro feel to their band name. 
The logic behind 'Acme' was similar. 
I felt it looked suitably retro while also being easy to read for the main bodies
of text. For larger blocks of text I will use 'Muli'
CTAs - I used call-to-action buttons on the homepage for booking enquiries, 
booking tickets and following the band on social media (found on the footer).

I will have a callout container on the top of the page showing the band performing. 
This will take up most of the homepage upon loading to show. There will be seperate
 callout containers further down the page with CTA buttons for both booking and 
 tour dates. 
Underneath the top callout container there will be a media area in which you can watch 
and listen to some of the band's material. 
The footer will contain a 'Subscribe' button. I will also have a 'Follow Us' section 
in which all the main social media options will be there for fans to follow 
'The Monkees' on. 

<h3>User Stories</h3>
As a user, I want to be able to listen to The Monkees music on their website 
and watch videos of old performances.

As a user, I want to be able to see if they have any upcoming shows and book 
tickets quickly if so desired.

As a user, I want to be able to follow social media accounts of the band from 
their website.

As a user, I want to be able to make booking enquiries for the band to perform 
at wedding/birthday party/other event. 

As a user, I want to be able to see photos of the band. 



This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, 
diagrams etc. that 
you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either
be included
in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere 
online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and 
describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Bookings Form - allows users interested in booking the band to make an enquiry,
by having them fill out an enquiry form. This was originally to be a modal 
however after discussions with mentor, it was changed to a form on the
bookings.html page under 'What We Do'. The bookings.html page in itself can be 
accessed via the navbar or the callout on the homepage. 
On the bookings.html page, there is a 'What people say about us' section for 
those interested in  booking the band to see how previous bookings have been 
reviewed.


tour-dates.html - allows users interested in seeing the band live to view their 
tour dates, venues and click a ticket icon to take them to a ticketing website. 

'Listen' - on the homepage allows users to listen to some of the band's 
greatest hits. 

'Watch' - on the homepage gives users a video of the band performing which can 
be considered as an incentive to see them live or book them for an event.

'Footer' - has a subscribe button for users to subscribe to newsletters as well 
as links to various social media buttons. 'Follow Us' - on the homepage gives 
users a convenient place to find their social media platforms of choice to 
follow the band on. 



<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
Bootstrap library was used to aid development with its grid system, navigation 
menu, modals, etc. Bootstrap 3.3.7
jQuery was used to aid the implementation of Bootstrap (e.g. the burger menu) 
and to assist deployment of Fancybox
Google Fonts has been the source of the 'Spicy Rice', 'Acme', 'Muli' as I
believe the fonts are both clear and suitably 'retro' looking. 
I used Font Awesome for the social media icons button in the footer.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. 
A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

<h5>To listen to The Monkees music on their website and watch videos of old 
performances.</h5>
Go to the homepage. Scroll down to the selection of songs and click play.
To watch video, scroll further down homepage (below tour callout container) 
and click play on the embedded Youtube video. 
Alternatively, to listen to music, click on 'Our Music' on navbar. Select any song
from Spotify playlist featured at top of the page. 

<h5>To be able to see if they have any upcoming shows and book tickets quickly 
if so desired.</h5>
On homepage, scroll down to 'See The Monkees On Tour' callout container and click
on 'Buy Tickets And Show More' button. This will take you to the tour dates list. 
Alternatively, click on 'Tour Dates' on navbar to find the same page. Tickets 
can be purchased by clicking on the tickets button to the right hand side of the 
table. 

<h5>To be able to follow social media accounts of the band from their website.</h5>
Scroll to the footer on any page to get a link to each of the respective social 
media pages with the exception of Snapchat. Snapchat is a dummy link due to The
Monkees not having a page. 

<h5>To be able to make booking enquiries for the band to perform at wedding/birthday
party/other event. </h5>
On the homepage, scroll down to the bookings callout container which is below the 
Youtube video and above the footer. Click on the button to take you to bookings 
page. 
Alternatively, use 'Bookings' on the navbar to navigate to this same page. 
Fill in the form on bookings page to submit enquiry. 

<h5>To be able to see photos of the band.</h5> 
Using the navbar, click on 'Photos' to take you to the photos page on which you
can see a selection of photos of the band. 


On the 'Our Music' page, one bug has been found. The images for 4 of the 6 
featured albums that are clickable links to Amazon store do not show on Safari
(iPhone and iPad physically tested), Firefox or Edge. This can be fixed at a 
later date.

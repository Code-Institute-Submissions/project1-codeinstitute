I am building this website for a fictional band based on The Monkees. It is for
fans and potential fans. 
It is also aimed at giving people an opportunity to both listen to their music 
and book them to play at events.

<h2>UX</h2>
*Target audiences= fans and potential fans.

*To see/hear clips from back catalog, and new material as it becomes available.

*To showcase their music.

*To publicise availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas 
parties.

<h3>Strategy Plane</h3> <h4>What are you aiming to achieve in the first place 
and for whom</h4>
A website for fans, potential fans and customers who may want to book the band 
for events. 

<h3>Scope Plane</h3> <h4>Which features based on information from the strategy 
plane do you want to include in your design? </h4>

Enquiry form - for booking gigs. 

Band photos - images displayed in Bootstrap grid.

Spotify plugin - to allow people try band's music

Youtube plugin - To see/hear clips from back catalog and showcase talents on 
booking page.

Social sharing buttons - for fans to share music and engage with fellow fans.

Tour date page with button to third party site for tickets

<h3>Structure Plane</h3> <h4>How is the information structured and how is it 
logically grouped?</h4>
Interaction Design - I use a traditional navigation system with a navigation bar 
across the top as well as a band logo functioning as a link to homepage.

Information Architecture - I am to keep things clear and easy for users by having
seperate pages for bookings, tour dates, photos and news with identical nav and
footer layouts on all pages. 
The main section of the page will change but I aim to stick to the yellow, red 
and grey color schemes.


<h3>Skeleton Plane</h3> <h4>How will our information be represented and how will
the user navigate to the information and the features?</h4> 
[delete]Information Design refers to presenting the information in the way that 
the user can best understand it.
I decided that I would create four boxes on each page, one for each of the four 
types of information.
Scrolling would be used, as necessary, to allow all the desired information to 
be available within the box.
Interface Design means incorporating features like buttons in a way that users 
can easily interact with
the site. Since my site is quite simple I really did not need to do much design 
here. I just kept in mind
that my site should have a familiar look similar to other common sites.
Navigation Design is the method we provide for the user to move through the site,
successfully reaching
the desired sections. I decided to have three types of navigation:
(1) A top navigation bar that would be arranged alphabetically. This option would 
be suitable for
students interested in reaching my page about a particular course.[delete]
<h3>Surface Plane</h3> <h4>What will the finished product look like? or what 
colors typography and design elements will we use? </h4>

The design will be consistent and visually appealing to customers/fans. A retro
theme will be aimed for to match the time of the band's breakout years. 

Colors - red, yellow and white (matching the Greatest Hits logo and color scheme). 
Font - I used 'Spicy Rice' and 'Acme' both Google Fonts. I felt Spicy Rice was 
the perfect fit for 'The Monkees' - giving a retro feel to their band name. 
The logic behind 'Acme' was similar. 
I felt it looked suitably retro while also being easy to read for the main bodies
of text. 
CTAs - I used call-to-action buttons on the homepage for booking enquiries, 
booking tickets, following the band on social media and contacting the band 
through a form (found on the footer).

I will have a callout container taking up most of the homepage upon loading to show 
the two main things this band is about - tours and bookings. There will be seperate
CTA buttons for each option. 
Underneath this callout container there will be a media area in which you can watch 
and listen to some of the band's material. I will also have a 'Follow Us' section 
in which all the main social media options will be there for fans to follow 
'The Monkees' on. This 'Follow Us' section will take up a central space to act 
as a break between audio and video content and it will change layout depending 
on screen size. 
The footer will contain a 'Subscribe' button, a 'Contact' button and a smaller 
'Follow' section.

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this 
website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the
best way to help them achieve these things.



<h3>User Stories</h3>
As a user, I want to be able to listen to The Monkees music on their website 
and watch videos of old performances.

As a user, I want to be able to see if they have any upcoming shows and book 
tickets quickly if so desired.

As a user, I want to be able to share social media links to friends and 
families about the band from their website. 

As a user, I want to be able to make booking enquiries for the band to perform 
at wedding/birthday party/other event. 

As a user, I want to be able to see photos of the band. 



This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, 
diagrams etc. that 
you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either
be included
in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere 
online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and 
describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Bookings Modal - allows users interested in booking the band to make an enquiry,
by having them 
fill out an enquiry form. This modal can be accessed via the bookings.html page 
under 'What We Do'. The bookings.html page in itself can be accessed via the 
navbar or the callout on the homepage. 

tour-dates.html - allows users interested in seeing the band live to view their 
tour dates, venues and click a ticket icon to take them to a ticketing website. 

'Listen' - on the homepage allows users to sample or listen to (depending on 
whether they have a Spotify account) some of the band's greatest hits. 

'Follow Us' - on the homepage gives users a convenient place to find their 
social media platforms of choice to follow the band on. 

'Watch' - on the homepage gives users a video of the band performing which can 
be considered as an incentive to see them live or book them for an event.

'Footer' - has a subscribe button for users to subscribe to newsletters as well 
as links to various social media buttons. 

On the bookings.html page, there is a 'What people say about us' section for 
those interested in  booking the band to see how previous bookings have been reviewed.

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have 
used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.
I have used HTML and CSS to build this project. Bootstrap has been the framework (version 3.3.7). 
Google Fonts has been the source of the 'Spicy Rice' and 'Acme'. 
I used Font Awesome for the social media icons as well as the 'Contact Us' button in the footer.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site 
works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, 
link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. 
A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, 
even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

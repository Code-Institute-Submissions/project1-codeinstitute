I am building this website for a fictional band based on The Monkees. It is for fans and potential fans. 
It is also aimed at giving people an opportunity to both listen to their music and book them to play at events.

<h2>UX</h2>
*Target audiences= fans and potential fans.

*To see/hear clips from back catalog, and new material as it becomes available.

*To showcase their music.

*To publicise availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.

<h3>Strategy Plane</h3> <h4>What are you aiming to achieve in the first place and for whom</h4>
A website for fans, potential fans and customers who may want to book the band for events. 

<h3>Scope Plane</h3> <h4>Which features based on information from the strategy plane do you want to include in your design? </h4>

Enquiry form - for booking gigs. 

Band photos - image carousel

Spotify plugin - to allow people try band's music

Youtube plugin - To see/hear clips from back catalog and showcase talents on booking page.

Social sharing buttons - for fans to share music and engage with fellow fans.

Tour date page with button to third party site for tickets

<h3>Structure Plane</h3> <h4>How is the information structured and how is it logically grouped?</h4>
Interaction Design - I use a traditional navigation system with a navigation bar across the top as well as the band logo functioning as a link to homepage.

Information Architecture - I am to keep things clear and easy for users by having seperate pages for bookings, tour dates, photos and news
refers to organizing the information in a way that users can best understand it. The aim is to use
a similar structure on each page so the user experience will be consistent. 

<h3>Skeleton Plane</h3> <h4>How will our information be represented and how will the user navigate to the information and the features?</h4> 
[delete]Information Design refers to presenting the information in the way that the user can best understand it.
I decided that I would create four boxes on each page, one for each of the four types of information.
Scrolling would be used, as necessary, to allow all the desired information to be available within the box.
Interface Design means incorporating features like buttons in a way that users can easily interact with
the site. Since my site is quite simple I really did not need to do much design here. I just kept in mind
that my site should have a familiar look similar to other common sites.
Navigation Design is the method we provide for the user to move through the site, successfully reaching
the desired sections. I decided to have three types of navigation:
(1) A top navigation bar that would be arranged alphabetically. This option would be suitable for
students interested in reaching my page about a particular course.[delete]
<h3>Surface Plane</h3> <h4>What will the finished product look like? or what colors typography and design elements will we use? </h4>


Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.



In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
<h3>User Stories</h3>
As a user, I want to be able to listen to The Monkees music on their website and watch videos of old performances.

As a user, I want to be able to see if they have any upcoming shows and book tickets quickly if so desired.

As a user, I want to be able to share social media links to friends and families about the band from their website. 

As a user, I want to be able to make booking enquiries for the band to perform at wedding/birthday party/other event. 

As a user, I want to be able to see photos of the band. 


As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
